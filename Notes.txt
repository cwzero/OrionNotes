- Platonic Divide: the concept that physical reality is separate from the idea of the physical reality
- Physical things become abstract ideas, abstract concepts become physical objects, and all of it is grayer than expected and fluid
- Platonic Ideals: the idea of the conceptual essential nature of a thing

- Magic users must be freed from the protection offered by the veil.  This allows for magic but exposes the dangers of the dreaming
- Characters have to be careful not to accidentally reshape things (accidental magic)
- Characters form their own unique belief systems, which derive their powers etc

- Characters must receive a spark of divinity to engage in the journey
- Characters must forge and maintain bonds (relationships) with the entity that gave them their spark, as well as other things to base
    their magic around
- Bonds must be forged at each layer of the dreaming to enable travel, if you don't have the right bonds you will get lost

- If a character's spark is reclaimed by the giver, their soul is ripped apart
- Why is your character broken?

- "The Magicians" / "Narnia" / Lovecraft Dreamlands

- Fragmentation (realities break down into fragments)
- Rituals (belief systems create rituals with effects)
- Doors (Gateways, objects or rituals which form tethers and paths between places)
- Tasks (one-time ritual-like task to accomplish a goal)
- Quests (magic, meta-ritual composed of smaller tasks)
- Curses (rituals which must be observed any time it's appropriate to avoid a consequence)
- "Vampires" (creatures who sustain by absorbing the life-force of others)
    - Fear Eaters (invoke and consume fear)

- Omens
- Oracles, Visions

- Disease (magic use risks infection, leading to madness - characteristics of the disease will be determined as part of the game)
    - Multiple diseases, platonic gray, diseases are maybe like possession by some living intelligent horror
